v1.0

Not released on CRAN.

v1.1

CRAN legal- passed all checks.

v1.2

Bug Fixes:

x and y axis limits can now be reversed without error

New Features:

magplot parses better to plot, allowing generic plotting of plot.density plot.histogram etc.

Improved the behaviour of tick labelling by making use of the axis function (which tries hard to avoid text collisions).

Generalised the labelling system with a mid level function maglab. This makes it easier for the end user to cope with specific scenarios where the default behaviour is not desired.

Added more flexibility to control the outcome from magplot, meaning users should not need to access magaxis and maglab in most scenarios.

v1.3

Bug Fixes:

When labels were FALSE plotting ticks alone wasn't working, now fixed.

Changed code to use mtext instead of title for axis labels- this means labels are plotted when using layout.

I've fixed a couple of plot label formatting issues. This fixes some situations where expressions were not being used, and changes 0x10^0 to 0.

New Features:

Allowed nice printing of smaller dynamic ranges in log plots by using powers of 10 times 1, 2 and 5 when the range covered is less than or equal to 50.

v1.4

Bug Fixes:

Clarified some help entries, and fixed some typos.

Fixed bug with logpretty in magaxis that meant it wasn't dealing with vector arguments correctly.

New Features:

Added vector support for majorn minorn so they can be defined separately for each axis.

Added option to define the pretty gap to aim for (useful for degrees which are 45/90 rather than 50/100). This is prettybase- as an example this can be set to 45 for plotting degrees nicely.

v1.5

Added option for fully Hershey font output.

Added magerr error bar plotting function.

Added magmap variable mapping functions to allow for pretty and easy colour scaling.

Added a hard trim option to maglab to ensure no values fall outside of original range.

Fixed some help entries (nothing serious).

Fixed bug in usemultloc that extended the range beyond that desired.

v1.6

Added the magrun plotting feature, which allows for easy generation of running medians and other quantiles.

Fixed some help file entries

Added pretty in-plot colour bar. This makes 'magic' use of the plotrix version, i.e. it works hard to produce a useful output painlessly.

v 1.7

Fixed error in magmap that meant flip was always from 0 -> range[2]-range[1], not from range[1] -> range[2]

TO DO:

Add better in-plot legends.
