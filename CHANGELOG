v1.0

Not released on CRAN.

v1.1

CRAN legal- passed all checks.

v1.2

Bug Fixes:

x and y axis limits can now be reversed without error

New features:

magplot parses better to plot, allowing generic plotting of plot.density plot.histogram etc.

Improved the behviour of tick labelling by making use of the axis function (which tries hard to avoid text collisions).

Generalised the labelling system with a mid level function maglab. This makes it easier for the end user to cope with specific scenarios where the default behaviour is not desired.

Added more flexibility to control the outcome from magplot, meaning users should not need to access magaxis and maglab in most scenarios.
